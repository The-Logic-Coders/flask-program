# Lesson 0: Introduction to Flask and Setting Up the Development Environment 

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what Flask framework is and what it's used for.
- Set up the python development environment for Flask.
- 

## What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. Itâ€™s designed to make getting started with web development quick and easy, while still being powerful enough to build complex web applications.

## How to set up the Flask application

### Step 1: Install Flask
In Windows, at the Visual Studio Code terminal, type: 
```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Step 2: Clone Project Directory 
Get the initial setup files for the Flask application and navigate to the appropriate lesson directory:

**Instructions:**

In the terminal of Visual Studio Code, type the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Logic-Coders/flask-program.git
```
Change into the cloned project directory:
```bash
cd flask-program
```
Navigate to the Lesson 0 directory and then to the python code examples:
```bash
cd Lesson-0/python-code-examples
```
### Step 3: Test Flask
Verify that flask and the project setup are correctly configured.

Still in the Visual Studio Code terminal, and ensuring you are in the correct directory (`flask-program/Lesson-0/python-code-examples`), execute the Flask application with the following command:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

Open a web browser (Google Chrome) and go to `localhost:5000/` to see if the Flask application is running correctly. If it is running correctly, you'll see something like this:
